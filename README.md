This is a project I made for my final programming module grade for 1st year.

The program allows you to Save/Delete, Edit and Sort a games history record, so that the user can save their playthroughs and game collections to look back on at a future date. The user can also see how much their full collection is worth for example and perform other similar calculations should they wish to.

This program was written in Java and makes use of the console menu with no Swing GUI per the specification I was given.
